# Reading List: September 2021

Here's a list of articles, courses, books, videos, and any other things that I found personally interesting and went through them:

### Articles on Finance on [Tickertape.in](https://www.tickertape.in/)
Call it a temporary whim, but I've been looking into Finance and Economics *stuff* (pardon me, I've never given it much attention before). Tickertape has a [series of educational articles](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/), directed towards concepts in economics and finance, and aims to provide a foundation for getting started in equity market investing. This series has four modules, and I've read the first one, [Elementary Economics](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/intro-to-macro-economics/), which consists of the following articles:
1. [Intro to Macroeconomics](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/intro-to-macro-economics/)
2. [Interest Rates & Forex](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/interest-rates-forex/)
3. [Circular Flow](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/circular-flow/)
4. [Monetary Policy](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/monetary-policy/)
5. [Deficits & Balance of Payments](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/deficits-balance-of-payments/)
6. [Fiscal Policy](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/fiscal-policy/)
Now this is most likely very fundamental for most people, but frankly, it's quite new for me, and I'm finding it really interesting so far!

### MLOps Articles by [Tezan Sahu](https://tezansahu.medium.com)
I've been exploring Machine Learning and DevOps separately for the past few months, and I've heard about the buzz around MLOps, a field which brings the practice of Machine Learning into real-world production systems and processes. 
This series of articles seems very promising in teaching the principles of MLOps, by first explaining what the DevOps culture and principles are, relating them to MLOps, and also outlining what's different. It then explains the ML workflow, and the principles that MLOps in particular advocates.

[A Gentle Introduction to MLOps](https://tezansahu.medium.com/fundamentals-of-mlops-part-1-a-gentle-introduction-to-mlops-1b184d2c32a8)

### Authentication system using Ethereum
This article is a part of a trilogy of articles that introduce Ethereum and Smart Contracts, written by Sebastian Peyrott. Besides being a great introduction to Ethereum and Blockchain in general, it also has small projects that demonstrate the prospects of Blockchain, which includes an authentication system uses Ethereum to verify an individual's identity. I came across this series thanks to a college assignment. However, the series is from 2017, so some of the code is deprecated.

[An Introduction to Ethereum and Smart Contracts: an Authentication Solution](https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-ethereum-and-smart-contracts-part-3/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)

It's also available as a [PDF](https://assets.ctfassets.net/2ntc334xpx65/42fINJjatOKiG6qsQQAyc0/8b63e552f4cfef313f579b8e9c9154b5/intro-to-ethereum.pdf).

### Natural Language Processing
As part of my Final Year project, I am currently studying NLP, and I went through these articles/courses, and found them worth sharing:
* [The Illustrated Transformer by Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/): This article explains the Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks
* [NLP For You, a course by Lena Voita](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist): A text-based course on the fundamental concepts on NLP, including Word Embeddings, Text Classification, Language Modeling, Seq2seq, Attention, Transformer and Transfer Learning - this is a treasure!
* [CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z) is a MOOC with lectures available on YouTube

Thanks to my friends [Arnav Shah](https://arnavsshah.github.io/) and [Saharsh Jain](https://saharshleo.github.io/) for suggesting these resources!

### A Project of One's Own
Probably a classic now, I came across this [article](http://paulgraham.com/own.html) by Paul Graham. Go ahead and read it for yourself!

### How to Remember What You Read
This [great article](https://fs.blog/2021/08/remember-books/?utm_source=pocket_mylist) by Farnam Street is something that I was thinking about for a long time before I actually googled this question and came across this article.
