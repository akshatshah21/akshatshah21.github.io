With a keen interest in programming and software, I am looking forward to improve my skills and work on projects and problems in the fields of Full Stack Web Development, DevOps and Machine Learning. Besides these, you'll find me active on competitive programming websites and venturing into the sport of [CTFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)). You can see some of my projects [here](https://github.com/akshatshah21).

I graduated with a Bachelors in Technology (Information Technology) from [VJTI](https://vjti.ac.in/), Mumbai, in June 2022. I'm currently a Software Engineer at Wells Fargo, Bengaluru. In my free time, I like to read, write and listen to my unvarying playlist of music. I'm always in for a good, meaningful movie or TV show, and I like to try my luck at badminton and carrom!

# Skills and Tech
My academic courses include the core subjects of Computer Science, like Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Database Management Systems and Computer Networks. Along with these, notable courses include System Administration, Machine Learning, Blockchain Technology, Software Engineering and Object Oriented Analysis and Design.

I'm proficient in C++, JavaScript and Python, and familiar with Java. Having done many projects in Web Development, I'm fluent in languages and web frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, TailwindCSS, Flask and Express JS. I have worked with SQL databases like PostgreSQL, as well as with NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Firebase Realtime Database and Neo4J. Apart from Web Development, I have done a few native Android Development projects using Java and Kotlin, and have had a stint of dabbling in Robotics in my First Year. In the past year I have studied Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, practising on problems using Scikit-learn and PyTorch. 

Currently, I am learning about the design and development of applications using .NET Core and related tools, focusing on the principles of software development and clean and maintainable code.
