The Question Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
You can solve this question on LeetCode.
Solutions Use a &amp;ldquo;map&amp;rdquo; to mark presence A simple way (albeit requiring linear auxilliary space) is to traverse through the given array, and mark all the positive number present in the array as present using a simple boolean array of size equal to the maximum number present in the array.</description></item><item><title>Coding Problem: Serialize a Binary Tree</title><link>http://akshatshah21.github.io/dcp-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 11:14:53 +0530</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://akshatshah21.github.io/dcp-3/</guid><description>DailyCodingProblem is a great website that sends coding problems to your inbox daily.
The Question Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The Question Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
Examples [1, 2, 3], k = 4 Yes, since 1+3 = 4
[10, 15, 3, 7], k=17 Yes, since 10+7 = 17
[5, 4, 7, 12, 1], k = 2 No</description></item></channel></rss>
