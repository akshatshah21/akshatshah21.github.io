# Reading List: September
Here's a list of articles, courses, books, videos, and any other things that I found personally interesting and went through them:

### Articles on Finance on [Tickertape.in](https://www.tickertape.in/)
Call it a temporary whim, but I've been looking into Finance and Economics *stuff* (pardon me, I've never given it much attention before). Tickertape has a [series of educational articles](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/), directed towards concepts in economics and finance, and aims to provide a foundation for getting started in equity market investing. This series has four modules, and I've read the first one, [Elementary Economics](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/intro-to-macro-economics/), which consists of the following articles:
1. [Intro to Macroeconomics](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/intro-to-macro-economics/)
2. [Interest Rates & Forex](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/interest-rates-forex/)
3. [Circular Flow](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/circular-flow/)
4. [Monetary Policy](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/monetary-policy/)
5. [Deficits & Balance of Payments](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/deficits-balance-of-payments/)
6. [Fiscal Policy](https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/fiscal-policy/)
Now this is most likely very fundamental for most people, but frankly, it's quite new for me, and I'm finding it really interesting so far!

### MLOps Articles by [Tezan Sahu](https://tezansahu.medium.com)
I've been exploring Machine Learning and DevOps separately for the past few months, and I've heard about the buzz around MLOps, a field which brings the practice of Machine Learning into real-world production systems and processes.
