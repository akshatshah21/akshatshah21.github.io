<h3 id="articles-on-finance-on-tickertapeinhttpswwwtickertapein">Articles on Finance on <a href="https://www.tickertape.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Tickertape.in</a></h3>
<p>Call it a temporary whim, but I&rsquo;ve been looking into Finance and Economics <em>stuff</em> (pardon me, I&rsquo;ve never given it much attention before). Tickertape has a <a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">series of educational articles</a>, directed towards concepts in economics and finance, and aims to provide a foundation for getting started in equity market investing. This series has four modules, and I&rsquo;ve read the first one, <a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/intro-to-macro-economics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Elementary Economics</a>, which consists of the following articles:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/intro-to-macro-economics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Intro to Macroeconomics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/interest-rates-forex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Interest Rates &amp; Forex</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/circular-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Circular Flow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/monetary-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Monetary Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/deficits-balance-of-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Deficits &amp; Balance of Payments</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/fiscal-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Fiscal Policy</a>
Now this is most likely very fundamental for most people, but frankly, it&rsquo;s quite new for me, and I&rsquo;m finding it really interesting so far!</li>

<h3 id="mlops-articles-by-tezan-sahuhttpstezansahumediumcom">MLOps Articles by <a href="https://tezansahu.medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Tezan Sahu</a></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring Machine Learning and DevOps separately for the past few months, and I&rsquo;ve heard about the buzz around MLOps, a field which brings the practice of Machine Learning into real-world production systems and processes.
This series of articles seems very promising in teaching the principles of MLOps, by first explaining what the DevOps culture and principles are, relating them to MLOps, and also outlining what&rsquo;s different. It then explains the ML workflow, and the principles that MLOps in particular advocates.</p>
<p><a href="https://tezansahu.medium.com/fundamentals-of-mlops-part-1-a-gentle-introduction-to-mlops-1b184d2c32a8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">A Gentle Introduction to MLOps</a></p>
<h3 id="authentication-system-using-ethereum">Authentication system using Ethereum</h3>
<p>This article is a part of a trilogy of articles that introduce Ethereum and Smart Contracts, written by Sebastian Peyrott. Besides being a great introduction to Ethereum and Blockchain in general, it also has small projects that demonstrate the prospects of Blockchain, which includes an authentication system uses Ethereum to verify an individual&rsquo;s identity. I came across this series thanks to a college assignment. However, the series is from 2017, so some of the code is deprecated.</p>
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-ethereum-and-smart-contracts-part-3/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">An Introduction to Ethereum and Smart Contracts: an Authentication Solution</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also available as a <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2ntc334xpx65/42fINJjatOKiG6qsQQAyc0/8b63e552f4cfef313f579b8e9c9154b5/intro-to-ethereum.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PDF</a>.</p>
<h3 id="natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing</h3>
<p>As part of my Final Year project, I am currently studying NLP, and I went through these articles/courses, and found them worth sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">The Illustrated Transformer by Jay Alammar</a>: This article explains the Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks</li>
<li><a href="https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">NLP For You, a course by Lena Voita</a>: A text-based course on the fundamental concepts on NLP, including Word Embeddings, Text Classification, Language Modeling, Seq2seq, Attention, Transformer and Transfer Learning - this is a treasure!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning</a> is a MOOC with lectures available on YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to my friends <a href="https://arnavsshah.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Arnav Shah</a> and <a href="https://saharshleo.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Saharsh Jain</a> for suggesting these resources!</p>
<h3 id="a-project-of-ones-own">A Project of One&rsquo;s Own</h3>
<p>Probably a classic now, I came across this <a href="http://paulgraham.com/own.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">article</a> by Paul Graham. Go ahead and read it for yourself!</p>
<h3 id="how-to-remember-what-you-read">How to Remember What You Read</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://fs.blog/2021/08/remember-books/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">great article</a> by Farnam Street is something that I was thinking about for a long time before I actually googled this question and came across this article.</p>
