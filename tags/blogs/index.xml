<h3 id="productivity-methods">Productivity Methods</h3>
<p>I stumbled across the following posts by Devi Parikh while going through <a href="" rel="">this</a> repo:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://deviparikh.medium.com/calendar-in-stead-of-to-do-lists-9ada86a512dd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Calendar. Not to-do lists</a>: This post discusses some principles for time management. it makes the argument for using calendar to manage your time and tasks, not to-do lists. According to Parikh, to-do lists are too disorganized (especially in the time dimension, which is what we&rsquo;re trying to optimize). She then goes on to explain her method of using calendars, which involves making everything you do - not just work, but things like eating, sleeping, doing nothing - an entry on your calendar. She then discusses other principles - I found the calibration multiplier fascinating!</li>
<li><a href="https://deviparikh.medium.com/checking-email-to-inbox-zero-e00d478cdd4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Checking Email â†’ inbox Zero</a>: This is something I&rsquo;d heard about before, in the form of other terms like <em>Touching every email once</em>. This post outlines the motivation for being strict with your inbox, and dissuades procrastinating emails. Do what you need to do with that email whenever you open it, don&rsquo;t put it off for a later time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-confessions-of-marcus-hutchins-the-hacker-who-saved-the-internet">The Confessions of Marcus Hutchins, the Hacker Who Saved the Internet</h3>
<p>I love this <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-marcus-hutchins-hacker-who-saved-the-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">article</a>. It is a very well written story of Marcus Hutchins, the hacker who was responsible for stopping the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">WannaCry ransomware attack</a> in 2017. Apart from the cool hacker element, this article also remarkably addresses the real-world implications of cybersecurity, and the serious repercussions it can have on people and property. It delves into the grey world of Cybersecurity, and it made me think that there really isn&rsquo;t a stark line between cybercriminals and cybersecurity experts. They&rsquo;re really the same kind of people who study the same things, but are on different teams, with different intentions. This 70-90 minutes read is worth every second.</p>
<h3 id="dropout-a-simple-way-to-prevent-neural-networks-from-overfitting">Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting</h3>
<p>This is the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/srivastava14a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">original paper on Dropout</a>, a technique that is commonly used while training deep neural networks today. I knew the concept of dropout, but the way that the authors present it instilled a new way of thinking about dropout and how it curbs prevents overfitting, with the intuition tending more towards gradient-boosted machines and genetic algorithms than the simple principle of &ldquo;disallowing the network to get dependent on certain pathways&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="the-yolo-papers">The YOLO papers</h3>
<p>Many are aware that the <a href="https://pjreddie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">creator</a> of <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">YOLO</a> has written quite humorous papers for it. YOLO (You Only Look Once) transformed the field of object detection when it was published in 2016. It was much faster, used less computation and was at par with the state of the art. Apart from the surprise of how simple the model is, the papers really entertain their readers with subtle humour placed here and there. More versions of YOLO have been released since, but the initial versions were written by the same author: Joseph Chet Redmon, and these papers are fun.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger</a></li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "># YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I never thought that research papers could be written like these. Brilliant!</p>
<h3 id="how-to-plan-and-execute-your-ml-and-dl-projects">How to plan and execute your ML and DL projects</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://blog.floydhub.com/structuring-and-planning-your-machine-learning-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">blog</a> on FloydHub by Sayak Paul outlines good practices and tooling for machine learning projects, with a focus on reproducibility, versioning and low technical debt.</p>

<h3 id="articles-on-finance-on-tickertapeinhttpswwwtickertapein">Articles on Finance on <a href="https://www.tickertape.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Tickertape.in</a></h3>
<p>Call it a temporary whim, but I&rsquo;ve been looking into Finance and Economics <em>stuff</em> (pardon me, I&rsquo;ve never given it much attention before). Tickertape has a <a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">series of educational articles</a>, directed towards concepts in economics and finance, and aims to provide a foundation for getting started in equity market investing. This series has four modules, and I&rsquo;ve read the first one, <a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/intro-to-macro-economics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Elementary Economics</a>, which consists of the following articles:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/intro-to-macro-economics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Intro to Macroeconomics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/interest-rates-forex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Interest Rates &amp; Forex</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/circular-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Circular Flow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/monetary-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Monetary Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/deficits-balance-of-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Deficits &amp; Balance of Payments</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tickertape.in/learn/modules/economics-101/fiscal-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Fiscal Policy</a>
Now this is most likely very fundamental for most people, but frankly, it&rsquo;s quite new for me, and I&rsquo;m finding it really interesting so far!</li>

<h3 id="mlops-articles-by-tezan-sahuhttpstezansahumediumcom">MLOps Articles by <a href="https://tezansahu.medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Tezan Sahu</a></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring Machine Learning and DevOps separately for the past few months, and I&rsquo;ve heard about the buzz around MLOps, a field which brings the practice of Machine Learning into real-world production systems and processes.
This series of articles seems very promising in teaching the principles of MLOps, by first explaining what the DevOps culture and principles are, relating them to MLOps, and also outlining what&rsquo;s different. It then explains the ML workflow, and the principles that MLOps in particular advocates.</p>

<h3 id="authentication-system-using-ethereum">Authentication system using Ethereum</h3>
<p>This article is a part of a trilogy of articles that introduce Ethereum and Smart Contracts, written by Sebastian Peyrott. Besides being a great introduction to Ethereum and Blockchain in general, it also has small projects that demonstrate the prospects of Blockchain, which includes an authentication system uses Ethereum to verify an individual&rsquo;s identity. I came across this series thanks to a college assignment. However, the series is from 2017, so some of the code is deprecated.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also available as a <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2ntc334xpx65/42fINJjatOKiG6qsQQAyc0/8b63e552f4cfef313f579b8e9c9154b5/intro-to-ethereum.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">PDF</a>.</p>
<h3 id="natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing</h3>
<p>As part of my Final Year project, I am currently studying NLP, and I went through these articles/courses, and found them worth sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">The Illustrated Transformer by Jay Alammar</a>: This article explains the Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks</li>
<li><a href="https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NLP For You, a course by Lena Voita</a>: A text-based course on the fundamental concepts on NLP, including Word Embeddings, Text Classification, Language Modeling, Seq2seq, Attention, Transformer and Transfer Learning - this is a treasure!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning</a> is a MOOC with lectures available on YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to my friends <a href="https://arnavsshah.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Arnav Shah</a> and <a href="https://saharshleo.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Saharsh Jain</a> for suggesting these resources!</p>
<h3 id="a-project-of-ones-own">A Project of One&rsquo;s Own</h3>
<p>Probably a classic now, I came across this <a href="http://paulgraham.com/own.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">article</a> by Paul Graham. Go ahead and read it for yourself!</p>
<h3 id="how-to-remember-what-you-read">How to Remember What You Read</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://fs.blog/2021/08/remember-books/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">great article</a> by Farnam Street is something that I was thinking about for a long time before I actually googled this question and came across this article.</p>
